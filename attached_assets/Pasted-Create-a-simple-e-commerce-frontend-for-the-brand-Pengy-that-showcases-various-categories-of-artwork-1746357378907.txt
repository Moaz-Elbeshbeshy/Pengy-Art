Create a simple e-commerce frontend for the brand Pengy that showcases various categories of artwork. The frontend should connect to a Node.js and Express backend with Mongoose to manage and display products stored in a MongoDB Atlas database.

Key Features:
1. Website Branding:
The website's brand name will be Pengy.

Change the logo to reflect Pengy.

2. Categories of Art:
The website will showcase three categories of artwork:

Cartoon Characters Drawn on the Walls of Rooms

Sketches of Face Portraits

Digital Art

3. Product Page:
Clicking on any artwork should redirect to a product details page where users can see more details about the artwork, including a larger image, description, price, materials, and style.

4. Filter Sidebar:
Implement a filter sidebar that allows users to filter products based on the following categories:

Price: Implement a price range filter (min, max price). Keep the style of the filter bar the same as in the original design.

Mediums & Materials: Filter based on the following materials:

Oil

Watercolor

Acrylic

Airbrush

Color

Ink

Latex

Styles & Subjects: Filter based on the following styles and subjects:

Fine Art

Abstract

Modern

Street Art

Pop Art

Impressionism

Photorealism

Portrait

Landscape

Nature

Still Life

Beach

Nude

Floral

Animal

5. Search Functionality:
Add a search bar that allows users to search for artwork by name or part of the name.

The search results should be dynamically updated as the user types, fetching matching products from the backend.

6. Sorting:
Allow users to sort the products by:

Price: Low to High / High to Low.

Name: Alphabetical (A-Z / Z-A).

Sorting should trigger an API request to update the displayed products.

7. No Cart or Login Functionality:
There should be no cart or login functionality on the site.

8. Pagination:
Display the products in pages with navigation controls (Previous, Next, and page numbers).

Implement pagination with a page query parameter that fetches products based on the current page.

Backend Integration:
The frontend will make API requests to the backend for fetching products. The API will be built using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB Atlas database.

Filters: The API should accept query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination.

Product Schema: The backend will manage artwork details such as name, price, description, image, medium, materials, style, and category.

The API will support the following query parameters:

Filters: medium, style, price, name, size, color.

Sorting: sort (e.g., price, name).

Pagination: page, limit.

Search: name.

Design:
The layout should be responsive and clean, with:

A sidebar on the left for filters.

A main content area on the right to display products.

The homepage should feature the categories and allow users to navigate easily between different types of art.

Ensure the product grid, filters, and sorting work smoothly.
